# HiðŸ‘‹
I'm Cancai Cai, a programming beginner born in 2002.

I work on big data. I am interested in sql engine and streaming system, I have a dream of streaming query.

Reach me: cancai@apache.org

Here are some interesting communities I'm involved in:

- [Apache Calcite](https://github.com/apache/calcite) : Apache Calcite is a dynamic data management framework
- [Risinglight](https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight) : An educational OLAP database system

I also like to translate some documents in my spare time, but my English is not very good.

- [paper](https://github.com/caicancai/paper_reading_cn)
